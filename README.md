# Sudoku grid and digits detection

Nowadays, Sudoku solvers are literally everywhere. However, they are often tedious to use as one need to enter manually all the digits. Therefore, this project seeks to automate such task by detecting Sudoku grids, along with their digits, within pictures.

The grid detection is performed with *Computer Vision* techniques using the [`OpenCV`](https://opencv.org/) tools, while the digit recognition/classification is implemented as a *Convolutional Neural Network* based on [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/) framework.

## Dependencies

If you plan to run the scripts of this repository, you will need to install several `Python` packages including `torch`, `torchvision`, `opencv`, `scipy` and their dependencies.

To do so safely, one should create a new environement :

```bash
virtualenv ~/sudoku -p python3
source ~/sudoku/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt -y
```

or with `Anaconda`

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

First, you'll need to *train* the network, which is automatically performed by the [`model.py`](python/model.py) script.

```bash
python python/model.py
```

Then, you can either use the functions of [`digits.py`](python/digits.py) at your convenience, or use it as-is.

For example, for the [`empty_0042.jpg`](resources/images/empty/empty_0042.jpg) image :

```bash
python python/digits.py resources/images/empty/empty_0042.jpg
```

```
4 0 0 8 0 2 0 0 6
0 6 0 0 1 0 0 9 0
0 3 8 0 0 0 1 7 0
0 0 0 1 2 7 0 0 0
7 0 0 3 0 4 0 0 1
0 0 0 5 8 9 0 0 0
0 7 4 0 0 0 2 1 0
0 2 0 0 3 0 0 6 0
9 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 5
```

> There might be digits that are miss-classified. Most notably, it is not uncommon for the network to classify a `1` as a `7`. This should be improved in later releases.

It should be noted that the whole neural network is loaded each time the script is called, which takes more time than the actual detection. To amortize this cost, prefer calling the script with several input images.

```bash
python python/digits.py <image0> <image1> <image2> ...
```

You can also use the flag `-v` to display the intermediate processing steps.

## Annotated Sudoku grid database

This repository also contains Sudoku grid pictures, each with an associated `.dat` file reprensenting the digits in the grid.

```
resources/
└─ images/
   ├─ blurry/
   ├─ empty/
   ├─ filled/
   ├─ generated/
   └─ handwritten/
```

Each directory contains a different kind of pictures.

> Grids from the [`handwritten/`](resources/images/handwritten/) folder are not solvable grids. However, they can be used for Sudoku grid/digits detection.

# Random Sudoku grid generator

The script [`generator.py`](python/generator.py) generates random sudoku grids in `png` format.

> Grids are generated by [`solver.py`](python/solver.py) and have only one solution.

The graphics are produced with the [`pycairo`](https://github.com/pygobject/pycairo) Python library.

## Install `pycairo`

Because it depends on the `cairo` C library, the installation of `pycairo` isn't the same for each platform.

* `Ubuntu`/`Debian`
    1. Install `pkg-config` and `cairo`.

        ```bash
        sudo apt install libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev
        ```

    2. Install `pycairo` using `pip`.

        ```bash
        pip3 install pycairo
        ```

* `macOS`
    1. Install `pkg-config` and `cairo`.

        ```bash
        brew install cairo pkg-config
        ```

    2. Fix path according to [`stackoverflow.com`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55973489/trouble-installing-pycairo-through-pip3).

        ```bash
        export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib"
        export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
        ```

    3. Install `pycairo` using `pip`.

        ```bash
        pip3 install pycairo
        ```

* `Windows`
    1. Install it using `conda`.

        ```bash
        conda install -c conda-forge pycairo
        ```
